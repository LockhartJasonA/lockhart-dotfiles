# Lockharts Dotfiles

I got used to an old friends dotfiles and decided I needed some of my own. I
eventually found a repo I enjoyed and eventually had so many changes I needed
my own repo.

## install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LockhartJasonA/lockhart-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
